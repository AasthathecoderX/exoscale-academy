Welcome

This ADVANCED Course is where your Exoscale cloud architect journey begins. It will help you learn the core technical concepts, dive into networking components and configuration, and introduce you to critical cloud topics.

You learn about the Exoscale platform products, fundamental technology concepts (VMs, cloud-init, automation, scaling, data traffic, object storage, block storage, backup), and the necessary networking themes (switching, routing, network load balancing, and private networking). Furthermore, we look into more advanced topics like CDNs, database as a service, container orchestration, and cloud challenges.

This course targets people who do not need to sell cloud services or develop software for cloud platforms; it is aimed at cloud architects. So, we are talking about people with the to-be-build skillset of defining and implementing cloud infrastructure. Architects keep the cloud infrastructure up-to-date, scaling it up or down and saving operational costs.

### laaS+

Infrastructure as a Service is the cloud service model we support with the Exoscale platform and a bit more, hence, IaaS+.
