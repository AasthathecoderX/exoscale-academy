Explained

- Local Network between Instances
- Private networks can be freely created
- Instances must be in the same zone
- No Security Groups are in between
- Layer 2 - like a simple Switch connecting all instances
- Private IP Addresses/Subnets can be freely chosen best from reserved IP ranges
- IP Addresses must be configured via SSH/RDP or Cloud-Init
- Managed Private Networks can automatically provide IPs via DHCP

Reserved Subnets - can be used for private networks:

- 10.0.0.0/8
- 172.16.0.0/12
- 192.168.0.0/16

### Granular DHCP Support via the CLI

Exoscale's Managed Private Networks support granular DHCP configurations, providing enhanced control over network settings through the CLI.

- [DHCP Option 3] Default Gateway (Router): Sets the IP of the default gateway for external traffic.
- [DHCP Option 6] DNS Servers: Specifies DNS server IPs for domain name resolution.
- [DHCP Option 42] NTP Servers: Defines IPs for time synchronization with NTP servers.
- [DHCP Option 119] Domain Search List: Supplies a list of domain suffixes supporting multi-domain environments (limited to 255 octets).

### Gateway Considerations
An additional Gateway is required when:

- Connecting private networks over different zones
- Connecting private networks to the company network
- Connecting a private network to the internet
- Connecting private networks together

As Gateway, another instance can be used:

- Ubuntu with routing configuration
- VyOS Router templates
