Explained
Layer 2 - Switching

- Uses Mac Addresses (hardcoded into devices)
- Only for traffic in a local or private network
- Done by switches

Example Mac address: f8:4d:89:84:eb:8e

Layer 3 - Routing

- Uses IP Addresses
- For traffic and routing in a global matter
- Done by routers

Example IP address: 10.55.22.1/32

### Local Network

- Switches donâ€™t care for IP-Addresses - only Mac-Addresses Layer 2 !!!
- Each computer can talk to the other on the same local network
- And it must be on the same subnet

### IP Addresses
A subnet for one IP address

A subnet for two IP addresses

More subnets

A subnet for 256 IP addresses

### Routing Subnets
- Talk to different subnets --> router (gateway) must be used
- Gateway IP needs to be specified --> Gateway IP must be usually on same subnet
