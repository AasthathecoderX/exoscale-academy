Overview

Simple Object Storage (SOS) is an S3-compatible object storage to store your assets, files, and metadata. Furthermore, it is a cost-effective solution to support your application and backup or serve your data from any Exoscale zone with no hidden fees, using your existing S3-compatible tooling and a familiar API.

- Simple to use
- High-available, replicated 3 copies of each object
- URLs to files can be configured with ACLs
- ACLs (Access Control List) permission control:
    - private - only with API key accessible
    - public-read - everyone can read, e.g. for static files
    - public-read-write - everyone can read and write -> NOT RECOMMENDED
    - manual edit - grant specific permissions to other orgs

### Use Cases
Case – Static Files:

- Backups
- HTML-Files
- Pictures
- Videos
- Archives of various files (e.g., *.zip, *.tar, and for boot-strapping an app on a server)
- Best suitable for

- Not suitable for
    - Shared File Systems
    - Storage under Databases

Case – Static Web Files:

- Upload static files to S3
- Set ACL public-read either manually or automatically (e.g., WordPress plugin)
- Embed links to files directly in HTML
- Users will download files from SOS bucket
- Providing fast access and high-availability

Case – Backup Files:

- Install a backup agent on a VM (e.g., CloudBerry)
- Configure S3 bucket as target
- If restore needed:
