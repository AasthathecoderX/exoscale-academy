### Multi-Criteria Life Cycle Assessment by 2023

Exoscale is committed to conducting a **life cycle assessment** of our products and services under ISO 14040. This analysis will **show our** products and services **environmental impact** throughout their life cycle, from raw materials to disposal. We aim to complete this analysis **by** the end of **2023**.

Life Cycle Assessment (LCA) is a methodology used to evaluate the environmental impact of a product or service throughout its entire life cycle, from raw material extraction to disposal. ISO 14040 is a standard that provides guidelines for conducting LCA studies.

The LCA process consists of four phases:

- goal and scope definition
- inventory analysis
- impact assessment
- interpretation

**Goal and scope definition**: This phase defines the goal and scope of the study, including the purpose, intended audience, and system boundaries. The study's goal may be to identify the environmental impact of a product or service, compare different products or services, or identify opportunities for improvement.

**Inventory analysis**: This phase involves collecting data on the inputs and outputs of the product or service throughout its life cycle. This includes raw material extraction, manufacturing, distribution, use, and disposal. The data collected is then used to create a life cycle inventory (LCI).

**Impact assessment**: This phase evaluates the potential environmental impacts of the product or service based on the LCI data. This includes assessing the impact on climate change, resource depletion, ecosystem quality, and human health.

**Interpretation**: This phase involves interpreting the results of the LCA study and communicating them to stakeholders. This includes identifying areas for improvement and making recommendations for reducing the environmental impact of the product or service.

Overall, the LCA process provides a comprehensive approach to evaluating the environmental impact of products and services and can be used to inform decision-making and improve sustainability.

### Certified Energy Management by 2024

Exoscale is in the process of implementing an **ISO 50001 Energy Management System** (EnMS). This standard provides a framework for managing organizations' energy efficiency, reducing energy costs, and minimizing environmental impact. Our goal is to **complete** an **audit** against this standard **by 2024**.

ISO 50001 Energy Management System (EnMS) is a globally recognized standard that provides a framework for organizations to manage their energy consumption and improve energy efficiency. The standard outlines a systematic approach to energy management, including establishing energy policies, setting energy targets and objectives, implementing energy action plans, and monitoring and reviewing energy performance.

The goal of ISO 50001 is to help organizations reduce their energy consumption and associated costs while reducing greenhouse gas emissions and improving sustainability. The standard applies to all types of organizations, regardless of size or industry.

ISO 50001 certification can benefit organizations, including improved energy efficiency, reduced energy costs, enhanced environmental performance, and increased competitiveness. It can also help organizations to comply with energy-related regulations and demonstrate their commitment to sustainability and corporate social responsibility.
