### Overview

The average age of our server fleet is over three years old, and we have **a program** in place **to repurpose** older servers for non-customer-facing workloads to keep them in **use as long** as they are **practical**.

### Benefits

Extended Server Fleet Life refers to extending the lifespan of servers in a data center beyond their original expected lifespan. This is achieved by implementing regular maintenance, upgrades, and optimization measures to ensure that the servers continue operating efficiently and effectively.

By extending the life of servers, organizations can save money on purchasing new servers and reduce the environmental impact of disposing of old servers. It also helps to maintain a stable and consistent IT infrastructure, as there is less disruption caused by replacing servers.

However, it is essential to note that extending the lifespan of servers requires careful planning and management to ensure that they remain secure and reliable. Regular security updates and patches must be applied, and any hardware failures or issues must be addressed promptly to prevent downtime and data loss.
