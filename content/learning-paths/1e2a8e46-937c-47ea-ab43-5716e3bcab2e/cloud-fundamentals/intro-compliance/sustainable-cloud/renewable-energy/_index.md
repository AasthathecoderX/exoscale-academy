### Overview

Currently, **90%** of **our electricity** comes **from renewable energy** sources. This is a significant accomplishment demonstrating our commitment to **reducing** our **carbon footprint** and sourcing energy from environmentally responsible sources.

### Benefits

Renewable energy refers to the energy generated from natural resources that can be replenished relatively quickly. These resources include sunlight, wind, water, geothermal heat, and biomass. Unlike finite fossil fuels, which will eventually run out, renewable energy sources are sustainable and can be used indefinitely without depleting the resource.

Renewable energy technologies are becoming increasingly popular as the world seeks to reduce its reliance on fossil fuels and mitigate the effects of climate change. They are also becoming more affordable and efficient, making them a viable alternative to traditional energy sources.

Examples of renewable energy technologies include solar panels, wind turbines, hydroelectric power plants, geothermal power plants, and biomass energy systems. These technologies generate electricity and heat without producing greenhouse gas emissions, which makes them a cleaner and more sustainable option for powering homes, businesses, and communities.
