### Overview

We design our servers and custom storage node chassis from carefully selected **components** with **energy efficiency** in mind and a strong focus on **reducing energy** requirements and **operating costs**.

### Benefits

Energy-efficient design refers to the practice of designing buildings, appliances, and other systems in a way that reduces energy consumption and waste. This can be achieved through various strategies such as using energy-efficient materials, optimizing insulation and ventilation, incorporating renewable energy sources, and implementing intelligent control systems. The goal of energy-efficient design is to minimize the amount of energy needed to operate a building or system, reducing energy costs and positively impacting the environment by reducing greenhouse gas emissions.
