### Framework

#### TISAX (Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange)

*Is a certification designed for the automotive industry's assessment and exchange mechanism of information security.*

TISAX stands for Trusted Information Security Assessment Exchange. It is a framework for information security assessments developed by the German Association of the Automotive Industry (VDA) to ensure the security of shared data among automotive industry suppliers.

TISAX is based on the ISO/IEC 27001 standard for information security management systems and is designed to ensure the confidentiality, integrity, and availability of information exchanged between automotive industry partners. TISAX assessments are conducted by accredited third-party auditors who evaluate a company's information security management system against defined criteria.

TISAX assessments cover various information security topics, including access control, data protection, incident management, business continuity, and physical security. Companies that complete a TISAX assessment are granted a TISAX certificate, demonstrating that they meet the information security requirements of the automotive industry.

TISAX certification is becoming increasingly important for companies that supply products or services to the automotive industry, as it demonstrates a commitment to information security and provides a competitive advantage in the marketplace.

#### HDS (Health Data Hosting)

*Is a certification designed to reinforce personal health data protection and build a trustworthy environment around eHealth and patient monitoring.*

HDS, or Health Data Hosting, is a French legal framework regulating personal health data storage and processing. It applies to any company or organization that provides data hosting services for healthcare data in France.

Under the HDS framework, healthcare data must be stored and processed in compliance with strict security and privacy requirements. These include:

**Physical security**: HDS requires that data centers be equipped with adequate physical security measures, such as access controls, surveillance cameras, and fire suppression systems.

**Technical security**: HDS requires that data be encrypted at rest and in transit and that access to the data be restricted to authorized personnel.

**Organizational security**: HDS requires that data hosting providers implement various policies and procedures to ensure healthcare data's confidentiality, integrity, and availability.

**Privacy**: HDS requires that data hosting providers obtain explicit consent from patients to collect, store, and process their health data and comply with all applicable data protection laws and regulations.

Failure to comply with HDS requirements can result in significant penalties and fines. As such, healthcare data hosting providers in France must take HDS compliance very seriously and implement robust security and privacy measures to protect personal health data.

#### FINMA (Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority)

*Is a government financial regulation for supervising banks, insurance companies, stock exchanges, securities dealers, and other financial intermediaries in Switzerland.*

FINMA stands for Swiss Financial Market Supervisory Authority. It is an independent regulatory body responsible for supervising and regulating financial institutions and markets in Switzerland. FINMA was established in 2009 as part of a comprehensive Swiss financial market supervisory system reform.

FINMA's primary mission is to ensure the stability and integrity of the Swiss financial system, protect investors and consumers, and combat financial crime. It supervises and regulates banks, insurance companies, securities dealers, asset managers, and other financial intermediaries operating in Switzerland.

FINMA has the authority to issue regulations, conduct investigations, and impose sanctions on financial institutions and individuals who violate Swiss financial laws and regulations. It also works closely with other national and international regulatory bodies to promote financial stability and combat cross-border financial crime.

FINMA plays a critical role in maintaining the integrity and stability of the Swiss financial system and ensuring that financial institutions and markets operate safely and soundly.
