### Security Referential

**Organizations** can **need help maintaining** an ever-growing number of **compliance standards** and security frameworks.

**Exoscale has extensive compliance documentation** for various standards and security frameworks, **making it easy for organizations to meet** all the **requirements**.

The Security Referential is a set of standards and best practices that we follow to ensure the security of our infrastructure and services. It includes guidelines on access control, network security, data protection, and incident response.

The Security Referential is based on industry standards and is regularly updated to address new security threats and vulnerabilities. Customers can use the Security Referential as a reference for their security needs and compliance requirements.

### Certified Security

The **security of your data is our highest priority**, and we work hard to ensure that our platform meets the highest security standards.

We believe trust is essential. Therefore, **we regularly undergo third-party audits** to help you meet your compliance obligations.

### Secure Control Framework

To maintain that documentation, **Exoscale has developed its security referential** based on the 32 Control Domains of the SCF framework.

This referential allows us to implement **a single set of security controls** while meeting all the requirements of the **targeted standards** and frameworks.
