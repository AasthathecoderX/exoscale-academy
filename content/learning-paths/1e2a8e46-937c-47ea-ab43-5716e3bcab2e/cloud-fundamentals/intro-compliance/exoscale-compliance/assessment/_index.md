### Framework

Understanding the risks that could significantly impact the organization and its ability to achieve its objectives is critical.

Risks are typically grouped into three categories:

- Business Risks
- Compliance Risks
- Operational Risks

#### Business Risks

that could impact the organization's ability to achieve its objectives, for example, a natural disaster disrupting operations.

Business risk refers to the potential for financial loss or other negative consequences arising from internal or external factors affecting a company's ability to achieve its objectives. This can include risks related to market conditions, competition, regulatory changes, financial performance, operational issues, and other factors that can impact the success or sustainability of a business. Practical risk assessment and management strategies can help enterprises to identify and mitigate potential risks, minimize financial losses, and protect against other negative impacts.

#### Compliance Risks

that could lead to non-compliance with legal or regulatory requirements, for example, a data breach that leads to a fine from a data privacy regulatory body.

Compliance risk is the potential for financial loss or legal penalties arising from a company's failure to comply with laws, regulations, or industry standards. This can include risks related to data privacy, environmental regulations, labor laws, financial reporting requirements, and other areas of regulatory compliance. Non-compliance can result in fines, legal action, damage to reputation, and other negative consequences that can impact a company's financial performance and overall success. Practical risk assessment and management strategies can help businesses identify and address compliance risks, ensure regulatory compliance, and minimize the potential for financial and legal consequences.

#### Operational Risks

that could impact day-to-day operations, for example, a system failure that disrupts business processes.

Operational risk is the potential for financial loss or other negative consequences arising from a company's internal processes, systems, or human error. This can include risks related to technology failures, supply chain disruptions, employee misconduct, fraud, and other operational issues that can impact a company's ability to conduct business effectively. Operational risks can also arise from external events, such as natural disasters or cyberattacks. Practical risk assessment and management strategies can help enterprises to identify and mitigate potential operational risks, improve processes and systems, and minimize the potential for financial losses or other negative impacts.
