Reporting sustainability performance and strategies is vital for accountability and transparency. Tools like the Global Reporting Initiative (GRI) and Sustainable Accounting Standards Board (SASB) and frameworks like the EU Corporate Sustainability Reporting Directive (CSRD) set standards for reporting on environmental, social, and governance (ESG) criteria.

### 7 Factors to Make it Work!

- **Leadership commitment**: A firm commitment from top management is essential to prioritizing sustainability goals and driving change throughout the organization.

- **Employee engagement**: Employees are critical in implementing sustainability initiatives and driving continuous improvement. Companies should actively engage and empower their employees to participate in sustainability efforts.

- **Integration into business strategy**: Sustainability should be integrated into the overall business strategy rather than treated as a separate initiative. This ensures that sustainability goals are aligned with the organization's core objectives and priorities.

- **Measurement and reporting**: Companies should establish key performance indicators (KPIs) and regularly measure and report on their sustainability performance. This allows them to track progress, identify areas for improvement, and communicate their achievements to stakeholders.

- **Collaboration and partnerships**: Collaboration with stakeholders, including suppliers, customers, and local communities, is essential for advancing sustainability goals. Companies should seek opportunities to collaborate with others to leverage resources, share best practices, and drive collective action.

- **Innovation and continuous **improvement: Companies should continuously innovate and seek new ways to improve their sustainability performance. This may involve adopting new technologies, processes, or business models to minimize environmental impact and enhance social and economic benefits.

- **Transparency and accountability**: Companies should be transparent about their sustainability efforts and communicate openly with stakeholders about their challenges, progress, and achievements. Accountability mechanisms should be in place to ensure that the organization is held responsible for meeting its sustainability.
