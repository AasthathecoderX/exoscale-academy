### DEAMONSETs

DaemonSets have many use cases â€“ one frequent pattern is to use DaemonSets to install or configure each host node. DaemonSets provide a way to ensure that a Pod copy is running on every node in the cluster. As a cluster grows and shrinks, the DaemonSet spreads these specially labelled Pods across all nodes.
